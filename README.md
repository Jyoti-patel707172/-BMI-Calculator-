# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
💡 What I Built:
A BMI Calculator where you can:
Enter your weight (lbs) and height (in).
Calculate your BMI with a single click.
Get a personalized message based on your BMI value (e.g., underweight, healthy weight, overweight).
🛠️ What I Learned:
State Management:
Using useState to manage inputs and results dynamically.
Event Handling:
Handling form submissions and input changes with React events.
Basic Styling:
Designed the app with clean and responsive CSS for a polished look.
🎨 Sneak Peek of the App:
Here's how the app looks:
(Attach a screenshot or short video of the BMI calculator in action. You can also include a snippet of the UI to grab attention.)

🔧 Tech Stack:
React.js: For building the UI.
CSS: For styling and responsiveness.
🚀 Next Steps:
Add advanced features like metric unit support (kg/cm).
Enhance with animations and better accessibility.
